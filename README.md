# Unit Testing with Mockito

This is an introduction to unit testing using tools like Mockito.
It's made to help newcomers be familiar with the techniques used in our team.

In order to present the slides, you should install
[showoff](https://github.com/puppetlabs/showoff).
After installation, simply use `$ showoff serve` to start the server,
and then open your browser and point to `localhost:9090`.

Enjoy unit testing!
